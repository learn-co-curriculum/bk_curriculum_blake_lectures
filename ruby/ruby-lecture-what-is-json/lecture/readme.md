## Presenting The Conflict

What problem is this lecture solving? Our students are intelligent and need to
know *why* they are learning something before investing effort.

## Grounding In What We Know

Before you move on, make sure we review the relavent materials needed. For
example if you are about to go into Objects, do a quick review of what a method
is.

## New Material

### Topic

Be specific! [Link to small code](code_samples/001.sample.rb) examples in the `code_samples` folder that
demonstrate what you are teaching.

#### Common Metaphors/Techniques

Cover any metaphors or teaching techniques that work well.

### Topic 2

## Conclusion

An effective conclusion should:

  * Reemphasizes and clarifies the objective that the students have learned.
  * Reemphasizes the significance of that objective.
  * Assesses students’ mastery of—or progress toward—that objective (if not done earlier). 
  * Possibly add a teaser for the next "conflict"
