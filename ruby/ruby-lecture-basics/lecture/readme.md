## Presenting The Conflict

No real conflict here.

## New Material

Just walk through the code samples
Some gotchas for condionals, but the examples really walk through this stuff.
conditionals need an expression that returns true or false
conditionals can also use a truthy or falsy value
everything in ruby is truthy except nil and false
the most common expressions that return t or f are comparisons are ==, >,<,>=,<=, ||
you can also call methods in a conditional
conditionals can go at the end of a statement
conditionals can be nested
case statements are slightly more clear than if statements when there are many branches
ternary is syntactic sugar for an if statement
unless is the opposite of if, avoid it - it's confusing
